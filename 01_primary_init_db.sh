# Much of this was inspired by https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hot_Standby
#   which in turn references https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hot-standby.html
# I am doing this to support PostgreSQL 9.3 and have made several decisions based on that fact.

# I don't know whether Galaxy can make any practical use of a hot standby.
# My purpose for implementing is to support barman, which requires exclusive access to a pg9.3 to back it up.

# From the first reference above:
#   A hot standby provides:
#   - the ability to connect to the server and run **read-only** queries while the master instance is in archive recovery or standby mode.
#     - This is useful for:
#       - replication purposes, and
#       - restoring a backup to a desired state with great precision.
#   - the ability of the server to move from recovery to normal operation while users continue running **read-only** queries or keep their connections open.
